   <h3>"Shrek 2" Movie Poster</h3>

   <p><span>Application:</span> Adobe Photoshop
   <br> <br>
   <span>Description:</span> Yes, another movie poster; however, the endgoal for this one was to create a practical movie poster that could be seen in theater hallways. I chose this iconic film because it

   <br> <br>
   <span>Description:</span> This book cover was created for Katherine Applegate's "Wishtree". For context, it is about an old, tall, wise oak tree which the people of the town tie their wishes unto. The typography has a slight glow around it to give off the magical aura that is within the story.</div>
